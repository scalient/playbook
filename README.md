# The Scalient Playbook

This is Scalient LLC's official repository of coding standards, suggested library use, and design patterns. It is the
culmination of a decade of trial-and-error among the principals to write web-based software in a scale-free manner,
meaning that the one does not hit a technical wall when confronted with problems of ever larger complexity. While it's
quite an ambitious claim a solution to a significant portion of human endeavour, curing cancer is still more daunting
than having a comprehensive approach to webapp design and development.
